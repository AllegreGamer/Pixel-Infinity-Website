            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">THE STORY</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-8">
            STINK! follows the story of Alessandro, a man in his early thirties who embarks on a surreal and cathartic journey. During a nighttime stop at a highway rest area, his repressed frustrations and years of accumulated disappointments transport him to a distorted world where his inner demons take form as hostile creatures.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">A DEEPER MEANING</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-8">
            Beneath its irreverent facade, STINK! serves as a bold metaphor for managing repressed emotions and transforming pain into strength. The game delves into how negative experiences, rather than being buried, can be confronted and "expelled" in a cathartic way. With profane humor and a provocative aesthetic, STINK! addresses deep themes such as betrayal, abandonment, and the quest for personal redemption.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">THE ORIGIN</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
              This game was born from authentic pain, but aims to transform that pain into something constructive and entertaining. It's a love letter to anyone wrestling with their inner demons, a reminder that even the "dirtiest" emotions can become powerful tools for healing. Sometimes, to move forward, we must "return the shit" we were forced to swallowâ€”even if only in a video game.
